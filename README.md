> Unified control library for Gavive

## Getting Started
We use [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to showcase, document and setup playground for all of the controls part of the Gavive unified control library. Upon cloning the repository firstly install all the dependencies that the project needs by running the following command from the root directory:

```
> yarn install
```

[@gavive/empire](https://github.com/Gavive/empire) uses [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) as its package manager.

Once all the dependencies have been install you can run the following command to start Storybook:
```shell
> yarn run storybook
```
